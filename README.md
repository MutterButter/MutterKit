# MutterKit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MutterButter/MutterKit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MutterButter/MutterKit)
MutterKit is yet another IRC bot. It uses the homegrown Mango IRC library, and aims to be lightweight, flexible, and maybe even a little fun!

## Where to find it in action
(...when it's finished.)

* irc.ffirc.ml / #Metacity
* irc.lizardirc.org / #Metacity

...and others which I'll add when I get around to it.
